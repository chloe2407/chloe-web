Food waste is such a big problem in both developing and developed countries. It is one of the key factors that lead to poverty and overpopulation in developing countries. In developed countries, over 43 billion pounds of food in near-perfect condition get thrown out every year. \n In order to reduce this alarming percentage in developed countries, our team created PlanIt, an app that scans fruit or vegetables, using AI technology like Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks, to tell consumers or grocery store owners an accurate expiration date instead of relying on the storeâ€™s sell-by stickers, which can be oftentimes inaccurate. This reduces food waste in consumer buying and creates more informative buying decisions, while also allowing grocery store owners to sell more produce as they reduce food waste.",
